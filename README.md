# Plasma Instabilities Research

### 3/8/2023 Updates
Added Matlab file `KappaBump_AllSolScript.m` to `Ben's Code/Level Curves k vs gamma/Kappa Bump` folder.
This file computes all the roots for the Kappa Bump-on-Tail distribution and plots the unique roots.

### 3/6/2023 Updates
Added Ben's code for computing $\gamma$ and plotting $\gamma$ vs $k$.   
Added readme with relevant figures in `Ben's Code/Level Curves k vs gamma/Kappa Bump`.
