## Summary of Files
1. `Kappa_Disp_Using_Xie.m` Solves the dispersion relation for the kappa using Fourier series approximation for the complex integral as in the Xie/Weideman algorithm.
2. `Kappa_level_curves_k.m` Solves for the dispersion relation using Xie and the functional form via Mathematica with the spectral method as initial guess and plots all the solutions for $\gamma(k)$ for $k\in[0.1,1]$.
3. `Vlasov_1D_linearized_Steve_v3_Kappa.m` Third edition of the spectral method for solving VP with kappa equilibrium distribution.
4. `Vlasov_1D_linearized_Steve_v4_Kappa.m` Fourth edition of the spectral method for solving VP with kappa equilibrium distribution. **Differences??**
5. `dielectric_kappa.m` Provides the functional forms for the kappa dielectric functions for $\kappa=1,2,6$.
6. `zetaph.m` Code to produce Fourier series approximation in Xie/Weideman algorithm.
