# README
This folder contains subfolders for each distribution with code to compute level curves in each parameter. 

The Kappa/Generalized Lorentzian is found in the `1D` and `Projected1D` subfolders. These subfolders identify whether the model was derived in 1 dimension or projected into 1 dimension from a 3D model. We have been using the 1D model, but are switching to the projected 1D model to be consistent with Summers and Thorne (1991) starting May 2023.

## Sub-Folders:
- Maxwellian [empty]
- BiMaxwellian [empty]
- 1D Kappa [complete]
- 1D BiKappa [empty]
- Projected1D Kappa [empty]
- Projected1D BiKappa [empty]
